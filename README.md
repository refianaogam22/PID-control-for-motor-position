# PID-control-for-motor-position
This is the a simple circuit for PID Control for motor DC 12V position. This circuit control by an ESP32 Dev Kit 1 and motor driver L298N.
You can change the microcontroller by using arduino, but with ESP32 you can set the PWM pin until 12 bin and change the frequency until 5kHz compare to arduino uno R3 that only supoort for 8 bit.
The screen that used on this project is oled creen 128x64 0.96", but you can replace with another screen example with LCD 16x2.
